(** [already_guessed board (c1, c2)] is the function that determines if cell

    guessed if its value is Empty or a Ship. *)

    of size ([x], [y]), an empty ship array, and the board's shape ([x], [y]).

(** [insert_ship player start_cord end_cord size] inserts a ship given the
    starting and ending coordinates of the ship ([start_cord] and [end_cord])
    to the current players board and returns an updated player. If the [size]
    does not match the number of coordinates of the ship, then an InavlidB
    is returned. *)

    Returns the option of continue or loss *)
